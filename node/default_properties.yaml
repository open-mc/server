  # shaper is used to determine the shape of the noise
  # air_layers is used to fill all "air" parts (where the noise < 0)
  # ground_layers is used to fill all "ground" parts (where the noise > 0)
  # layers should be specified as ["block", threshold, "block", ...] ending with a block
  # or ["block", threshold, transition, "block", ...] to specify a transition range up to 256 blocks where both blocks are randomly mixed
  # Remember that fluids behave best with one waterTop/lavaTop/... layer at the surface
  # air_layers_repeat / ground_layers_repeat if specified will repeat the respective layers on the Y axis. It should be chunk-aligned (multiple of 64)
  # period specifies the size of the largest noise details in blocks. Minimum value: 4
  # roughness: 0 gives very smooth terrain
  # roughness: 0.5 is default and gives a nice balance
  # roughness: 0.9 gives very rough and fragmented terrain

  # Availabler shapers:
  # overworld - just like the overworld
    # `value` controls height amplification
  # flat - Ground below y=0. air above
    # `value` changes the y level of the surface
  # uniform - No offsets. Gives a uniform mix of air and ground
    # `value` controls air/ground ratio (0 = air only, 0.5 = even mix, 1 = ground only)
  # void - No ground
  # filled - No air
  # nether - Periodic tunnels, just like the nether

  # end - Periodic island layers, just like the end
